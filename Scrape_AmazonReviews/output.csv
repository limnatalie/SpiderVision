"HP DeskJet Plus 4155 Wireless All-in-One Printer | Mobile Print, Scan & Copy | HP Instant Ink Ready | Auto Document Feeder (3XV13A)",No Ink,1.0,Beware - they don't have ink for it.  Check the printer on-line and elsewhere and you'll confirm the correct ink cartridge is not available through prime.
"HP DeskJet Plus 4155 Wireless All-in-One Printer | Mobile Print, Scan & Copy | HP Instant Ink Ready | Auto Document Feeder (3XV13A)",HP Deskjet Plus 4155,4.0,"the only thing I dislike is the printer is not fast,  first I thought it was my internet service but it was not, cause I borrow someone else printer it went fast.  let see it only been a few days, quality great printing and another plus is  you do not hear it print, kudos on that too. For the price is a bargain so far.!"

"HP DeskJet Plus 4155 Wireless All-in-One Printer | Mobile Print, Scan & Copy | HP Instant Ink Ready | Auto Document Feeder (3XV13A)",So far so good,5.0,"So far so good. My mother purchased this from amazon under her account. This is a newly manufactured printer. Other reviewer mentioned ink not available on prime as yet. I was able to order ink from hp and bestbuy. Since the 67 cartridge is new, like the printer, it may take all vendors a few weeks to get it in stock. It came with color and black cartridges to get you started. Set up was fairly easy through WiFi and Bluetooth. So far so good."
