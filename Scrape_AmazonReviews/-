"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Excellent printer.  Don't listen to the negative reviews.,5.0,"First of all,  the negative reviews for this product were left by people who din't rate the product, but rated the shipping or were mad because they can't read a product description and thought this was a multi-function printer, which it is clearly not.  The lowest one-star review was from a reviewer who didn't know what they were doing.  A simple google search produced an answer to solving the power saving issue, straight from HP's web site  I'll explain that at the end of this review.This printer was purchased for use in an office environment running primarily macs with a few microsoft surface pros in the mix.  Initial configuration is done via the touch screen on the printer itself.  It's very simple and you can choose a setup wizard type scenario (self-managed) or more of a manual mode for IT people who want to set up a static IP.  I chose the latter. After the quick initial setup on the printer touchscreen, the rest was done on a macbook pro and involved downloading the setup software from HP.  The install wizard is as easy as it gets to connect via wifi or ethernet.  If you want to access settings again at a later time or tweak specific options, you can access the printer in a web browser via its IP address/default url for the embedded web server in the instructions if you didn't set a static IP (which you always should).  Adding the printer to other networked computers is as easy as going into your OS's control panel/system preferences printer settings and adding the printer which should show up on your network.Print quality is great.  We replaced an old HP 4700dn color laser which cost significantly more at the time of purchase and see no different in quality.  Print speed is also solid.  The pull out paper tray is the only thing on this that feels a little cheap.  Otherwise it's a hefty printer that seems well-built.To mitigate or eliminate the auto-shutdown mode, go to Network - Wired- IPv4 Configuration (if you did this already  in the initial touch screen setup using the IT-managed option, skip to the next part.)  Select Manual IP, and make it something like 192.168.2.109.  Change the last 3 digits to suit your needs depending on IP addresses already in use.  Then, go to Settings- Power Management - Shutdown Mode, set it to 8 hours just because and, most importantly, check the ""Disable shutdown when ports are active"" box.  I can confirm that this will completely eliminate this issue when the printer is connected via ethernet and has a static IP, and possibly for USB connections as well.  Feel free to comment if it works for wifi only connections."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",A Home Office Reviewer ‚úçüèæ,4.0,"The HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw printer was shipped in its original box and I received it with the box slightly damaged. I accepted it from the shipping carrier because the damage was on the top left side of the box so I didn‚Äôt deem it a big deal. I had a very hard time taking it out of the box. It was quite heavy and it was pretty snug in there. It has a very sleek look. The colors were white and off white. The printer came with a USB, a power cord, a couple of manuals and the limited warranty info.On the front of the printer, there are two tray types that you can open. You can use either Tray 1 or Tray 2 to load the paper type you want. On the back of the printer, there‚Äôs the power cord, 2 types of USB ports and a network Ethernet port. On the top of the printer, there‚Äôs another USB port, a slot where the printed pages come out of and a small touchscreen.To get started, I plugged in the printer and loaded some paper. It advises not to plug the printer USB into the computer as of yet. The power cord is not as long as I would like but it gets the job done. When the printer is turned on the touchscreen asks some simple questions like language and the country you live in and then it prompts you to finish the setup on the HP website (the printer did not come with an installation disk).I had to download the software through the link provided on the manual #2. During the software install, that‚Äôs where it will prompt you to plug in the computer USB and this cord is way too short. Would definitely need to order a longer cord if you don‚Äôt want the printer too close to your desk.It took a little bit of time for my computer to find the printer (maybe because my computer was a bit slow). It found a different model number as well. It looked close enough and installed the software anyway. It took about 10-15 minutes to download, setup and register the printer software.After all the tedious setup, I was now able to print a test copy. I made something in photoshop and printed it from the program. It printed out with a small margin. There‚Äôs probably a way to fix that. The image was printed on 20# paper and it didn‚Äôt seep through.Overall I give this printer an 8 out of 10.This printer is not like a standard printer where you can put it anywhere. It does take up a lot of space. You need a dedicated table to put this on if you want space for your computer and other office accessories. It‚Äôs heavy so be careful with moving it. The printer does constantly run and when it prints it‚Äôs sort of loud but not a huge issue. The cords were short but you could easily buy longer cords. The printing job was pretty good. There was no bleeding through the 20# paper I had on hand. The colors were vibrant and the text came out crisp. I would recommend this printer if you are looking to print professional looking documents.Thanks for reading my review, I hope this helps :)"
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Amazing Image Print Quality,5.0,"First, I have to point out, setup was amazingly easy with the touch screen to setup for WIFI. I didn't even need to install the HP driver/software suite to get it to work on my Windows 10 machine through the Wifi.It installed firmware without me having to interact with it, and outside of some touch issues in setup, which seemed to get fixed with the firmware update. There were no issues.This Printer is heavy! Seriously heavy, and this was compared to my old laser printer.But now to the main point. The picture quality for color replications is really amazing. Normally, colors look washed out using a laser printer. Now it can't really replicate complex colors 100%, and shadows kinda look like defining lines on colorful images. But, compared to some inject printers, this is really amazing. You also get more prints, and faster prints.Now, the only issue I have is toner replacements. I haven't needed any yet, but I cringe a bit looking at the price. When I looked last, the 414a where 140 each. Compared to the last gen M452 which is about 80 dollars for a kit of offbrand toner, and 308 for a kit of HP, which uses 410a.Would I still recommend this for professional or even households needing quick and fast printing. Absolutely, I just cringe looking at the replacement cost of toner being about the same cost as the whole system. I have a feeling the prices will drop though. About 89 dollars each is where I hope to see them in the future."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)","Designed to Pick Your Pocket, not to print",2.0,"This turned out to be an awful purchase, one of the worse I've made in a decade. It is a machine that itself is reasonably priced but is far LESS capable a printer and FAR FAR FAR more expensive than the model it replaced (of which I've had three).As a printer, it is mediocre. My chief complaint is that its paper handling is just bad. It is only 3 months old but has as many jams in its history as my 6 year HP451. It will such in 3-6 pages at a time, meaning it will jam & jam good. It is especially bad with labels. And in the process of unjamming the printer, you inevitably tear paper (or worse, labels) fragments of which remain in the machine to cause more grief. Again, its paper handling is 2 steps down from the HP451 that preceeded it (and about which I've had no complaints).Much worse, and something that would cause me to never buy another HP printer, is that they have designed their printer system to pick your wallet rather than print cost-effectively. That mean a host of software restrictions tending to bind you to HP branded toners. But worst of all the BS they've done is to put proprietary chips on each of their toners. So that ONLY HP toners  with their stratospheric prices will work. I've not seen a compatible brand yet that comes with a chip. So, you have to spend $180-240 for EACH of FOUR HP toners, then pry off the chip & try to manually insert it into a reasonably compatible toner & hope that it works. Ridiculous.Then they have software on the print that if you set it wrong, once inserted into one HP printer it will NEVER work on any other printer on Earth. Oh, and HP toners now have geographic restrictions much like DVDs. A toner from Europe won't work in an American printer.I had a nightmare of a software install as well. Because HP didn't update their web site to reflect that they model-specific drivers did not work with Win 10. After another wasted hour, did get that squared away.But absolutely nothing in this process justifies my past loyalty to HP. They are all but flushed after spending nearly $1000 on a round of toners."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",This is not a multipurpose printer,3.0,"After years of going through one multipurpose printer after another my selection of this printer was not intentional, although from a printing perspective it is a great printer. What I actually wanted was a multipurpose printer with all the bells and whistles like fax, copier, scanner, etc. I didn't have a clue it was only a printer until I got ready to scan a document. To my amazement, and later disappointment, it was only just a printer!!! Nothing more. Nothing less. Just a printer, so beware if you've always shopped for multipurpose printers because this is not the one."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Would Not Print Colors Correctly,1.0,"Ordered brand new 454 HP printer. Setup was not bad at all and it seemed to connect just fine. The black printing looked good, but anything printer with colors was not good at all...it looked to be ""out of phase"". Contacted three different HP techs and did everything they said to do....still would not print colors correctly. Since my printer was brand new, I asked for a new printer to replace the defective one; HP refused and said they would send me a ""refurbished"" printer....I said NO WAY...it was brand new! So, I sent the printer back through Amazon, which was GREAT by the way, and will just order another brand of printer. Very disappointed in HP after using their printers for over 20+ years. THANK YOU AMAZON for your outstanding service......not so much HP."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",So far so good,5.0,"I replaced an M451 which I loved with an M452, which constantly ran out of memory and failed to print.  I replaced the M452 with this M454 and the problems appear to be resolved.  Am I a fool to continue buying HP printers?  Maybe, but the results are very nice."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Just Buy it,5.0,"I ordered this one after spending 3 days of research and reviewing many products. I just got this few hrs ago. Im NOT a computer or electronically knowledgable person. but It literally took less than 10 minutes to set up.  I checked the printer by printing from 4 Mac laptops,4 I pads and 3 I phones and went smoothly as I expected. Buy this if you are looking for a great printer.BTW I usually dont write reviews but i am very impressed with this printer, so people like me don't waste time doing research or reading reviews to buy a printer."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Fast. Great printed color copies.,5.0,"So far very happy. Only disappointment is that with legal paper the tray does not close completely. Other than that small annoyance, very satisfied. It is worth buying quality paper."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",toner cartridges were not usable!,2.0,"I never got it to work because it was mailed with 4 toner cartridges but none of them had the computer chip required to use them... I looked all over the internet to but the chips separately but they were not to be found. I called HP and they said the chips are not sold separately. So I would have had to buy 4 new print toners, which would have cost two or three times the price of the printer... so I returned the printer. I think it would have worked great. It looked like new!"
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)","Stopped recognizing paper in tray and unable to duplex print, after 1 week of usage",1.0,"This m454 color printer was a final effort to continue using HP laserjets after 30 years of successfully using laserjets.  Failed on important functions such as recognizing paper in tray after 1 week.  This m454 replaced an m452 bought 14 months ago, which failed immediately and was replaced.  The m452 replacement lasted only 2 months past the warranty expiration before failing with major component faults. Bought this m454 in hopes that the m452 issues were a fluke but having the m454 fail in this way after 1 week is final straw.  Paper used was HP premium 90g so paper was not issue.  I need a reliable printer and these color hp laserjets have repeatedly failed to perform reliably."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",A monster in size and cost,1.0,"What a waist of money . Sure it prints fast but pictures are a no go, and it again only prints . It‚Äôs very huge"
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Quirky controls with dismal Wireless setup,2.0,"After reading numerous reviews of various printers, settled on the HP Color Laser Jet Pro M454dw. Minimal instructions provided and the setup was absolutely terrible, the printer was apparently manufactured within 30 days however had to download 13 different updates & patches. The Wireless never would connect, kept getting different error messages but mainly it claimed to fail joining my household Network due to MAC address filtering, which was not the case as the Router is set for static. Finally gave up on Wireless connectivity and tried enabling for Duplex printing only to find that when enabled, the Duplex involves manually feeding for the back page to print, very time consuming. The small touchscreen menu is painfully laid out and not intuitive. Returned and still searching for a decent Printer as this one is not it."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Headache,1.0,"Worked perfectly for three weeks, then malfunctioned with ""paper tray empty error"" for which there was no fix."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",poor print quality - smears,1.0,I'm so disappointed. I paid extra to get a quality laser printer for a home office. The manual feed pulls multiple pages at once so it jams. I have had it for 2 days and now it is printing blurry and smearing ink to other sheets.
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Auto Duplex setup,5.0,"Prints really nice copy.  I use laser gloss paper and make half size flip-up booklets.  The printer software installes as manual duplex using HP 453-4 software from HP online source.  You need to go to printers, select the HP454, then  manage, then printer properties, then device settings tab, and select Duplex Unit- installed before the machine will automatically print both sides automatically.  Once I had this in place the print output in color on gloss laser paper is faster then the Brother 4570CDW I replaced.Touch screen I do not use but is easy to read."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)","Problems More Than Once, Support Is Horrible",1.0,"I have only had this printer for a few months and multiple times I have had to contact support. I have spent hours with them for multiple problems.It is always overseas to someone that doesn't speak very good English.The HP Chat Support tool they use is horrible and disconnects while chatting with them, which means you then have to reconnect and start over with another tech.I would NEVER purchase this product, and in fact will not purchase another HP product."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Serial problems that require too much time to fix.,3.0,"First, the print quality is good and the colors are consistent. Once you get the desired product, it is going to satisfy you considering the price of the printer. This is one of four printers in our small law office and it serves me well when working. Unfortunately, the problems are many. Without notice, the default changes from pint on one side to print on both. Suddenly, it stops communicating with my PC. Maybe its the recently installed update to Windows 10. Roll that back and no change. Then it prints an email with gibberish on 50 pages or more, one line at the top of each, with no coherence in any line. Next, the PC cannot find the printer. Update drivers? None available. Now you download the ""fix it"" application and it cures everything . . . . but now the new software tells you that your PC cannot find the printer (even while it is printing) so you must close that each time you print. Finally, my first reorder of toner for the printer ran out almost as quickly as the ""starter"" set sent. My time must be spent helping my clients or with my family. One or two hours every week or two finding fixes for this HP is not worth it. This is my last HP. It's back to Canon for me."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Great Printer,5.0,"Love this printer!  It is quiet, prints when I tell it to.  It does not stay asleep when I print to it.Very glad I switched over from a ink cartridge to a toner printer."

"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",I would stay away from this printer. It jams very often!,1.0,"This printer did not meet my expectations for a Solid HP printer. I ordered it and an expansion tray and started using it the same day it arrived. The features seemed pretty nice and color output was pretty good quality. Its only after using it for a week that I discovered that at least 2 or 3 times a day the paper would Jam. I decided perhaps the paper I had was to thin (copy paper) so I bought some slightly heavier stock paper and the problem persisted so after trying almost all the solutions offered for paper jams, I decided to return it. I opted to try the higher priced M553 and that model has been working flawlessly."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Great color laser printer.,5.0,"I absolutely love this printer, I just wish the cartridges for it were not so outrageously expensive. So I still use my black and white printer whenever possible.  Do not order any other vendor cartridges for this except the HP recommended. There are a lot of cheap toner sellers out there And it‚Äôs not worth the aggravation they put you through."

It‚Äôs a solid color laser jet for home use. The toner is a bit pricey and the touchscreen leaves a bit to be desired, but you can‚Äôt beat the price. It reliably does its job. The auto page duplex setting is great. No more manual flipping pages. The mobile phone printing support is really convenient too. Most printers twice the cost don‚Äôt have these features."

Five hours later and still can't get it figured out.  I have the HP Smart app on Windows 10 and the printer is connected to the same WiFi network as my computer, but the stupid app can't find the printer.  I even did a factory reset on my new Windows 10 computer and it still didn't work.  I build computers so I'm computer savvy.

Maybe its the recently installed update to Windows 10. Roll that back and no change. Then it prints an email with gibberish on 50 pages or more, one line at the top of each, with no coherence in any line. Next, the PC cannot find the printer. Update drivers? None available. Now you download the ""fix it"" application and it cures everything . . . . but now the new software tells you that your PC cannot find the printer (even while it is printing) so you must close that each time you print.

"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Excellent printer.  Don't listen to the negative reviews.,5.0,"First of all,  the negative reviews for this product were left by people who din't rate the product, but rated the shipping or were mad because they can't read a product description and thought this was a multi-function printer, which it is clearly not.  The lowest one-star review was from a reviewer who didn't know what they were doing.  A simple google search produced an answer to solving the power saving issue, straight from HP's web site  I'll explain that at the end of this review.This printer was purchased for use in an office environment running primarily macs with a few microsoft surface pros in the mix.  Initial configuration is done via the touch screen on the printer itself.  It's very simple and you can choose a setup wizard type scenario (self-managed) or more of a manual mode for IT people who want to set up a static IP.  I chose the latter. After the quick initial setup on the printer touchscreen, the rest was done on a macbook pro and involved downloading the setup software from HP.  The install wizard is as easy as it gets to connect via wifi or ethernet.  If you want to access settings again at a later time or tweak specific options, you can access the printer in a web browser via its IP address/default url for the embedded web server in the instructions if you didn't set a static IP (which you always should).  Adding the printer to other networked computers is as easy as going into your OS's control panel/system preferences printer settings and adding the printer which should show up on your network.Print quality is great.  We replaced an old HP 4700dn color laser which cost significantly more at the time of purchase and see no different in quality.  Print speed is also solid.  The pull out paper tray is the only thing on this that feels a little cheap.  Otherwise it's a hefty printer that seems well-built.To mitigate or eliminate the auto-shutdown mode, go to Network - Wired- IPv4 Configuration (if you did this already  in the initial touch screen setup using the IT-managed option, skip to the next part.)  Select Manual IP, and make it something like 192.168.2.109.  Change the last 3 digits to suit your needs depending on IP addresses already in use.  Then, go to Settings- Power Management - Shutdown Mode, set it to 8 hours just because and, most importantly, check the ""Disable shutdown when ports are active"" box.  I can confirm that this will completely eliminate this issue when the printer is connected via ethernet and has a static IP, and possibly for USB connections as well.  Feel free to comment if it works for wifi only connections."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",A Home Office Reviewer ‚úçüèæ,4.0,"The HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw printer was shipped in its original box and I received it with the box slightly damaged. I accepted it from the shipping carrier because the damage was on the top left side of the box so I didn‚Äôt deem it a big deal. I had a very hard time taking it out of the box. It was quite heavy and it was pretty snug in there. It has a very sleek look. The colors were white and off white. The printer came with a USB, a power cord, a couple of manuals and the limited warranty info.On the front of the printer, there are two tray types that you can open. You can use either Tray 1 or Tray 2 to load the paper type you want. On the back of the printer, there‚Äôs the power cord, 2 types of USB ports and a network Ethernet port. On the top of the printer, there‚Äôs another USB port, a slot where the printed pages come out of and a small touchscreen.To get started, I plugged in the printer and loaded some paper. It advises not to plug the printer USB into the computer as of yet. The power cord is not as long as I would like but it gets the job done. When the printer is turned on the touchscreen asks some simple questions like language and the country you live in and then it prompts you to finish the setup on the HP website (the printer did not come with an installation disk).I had to download the software through the link provided on the manual #2. During the software install, that‚Äôs where it will prompt you to plug in the computer USB and this cord is way too short. Would definitely need to order a longer cord if you don‚Äôt want the printer too close to your desk.It took a little bit of time for my computer to find the printer (maybe because my computer was a bit slow). It found a different model number as well. It looked close enough and installed the software anyway. It took about 10-15 minutes to download, setup and register the printer software.After all the tedious setup, I was now able to print a test copy. I made something in photoshop and printed it from the program. It printed out with a small margin. There‚Äôs probably a way to fix that. The image was printed on 20# paper and it didn‚Äôt seep through.Overall I give this printer an 8 out of 10.This printer is not like a standard printer where you can put it anywhere. It does take up a lot of space. You need a dedicated table to put this on if you want space for your computer and other office accessories. It‚Äôs heavy so be careful with moving it. The printer does constantly run and when it prints it‚Äôs sort of loud but not a huge issue. The cords were short but you could easily buy longer cords. The printing job was pretty good. There was no bleeding through the 20# paper I had on hand. The colors were vibrant and the text came out crisp. I would recommend this printer if you are looking to print professional looking documents.Thanks for reading my review, I hope this helps :)"
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Amazing Image Print Quality,5.0,"First, I have to point out, setup was amazingly easy with the touch screen to setup for WIFI. I didn't even need to install the HP driver/software suite to get it to work on my Windows 10 machine through the Wifi.It installed firmware without me having to interact with it, and outside of some touch issues in setup, which seemed to get fixed with the firmware update. There were no issues.This Printer is heavy! Seriously heavy, and this was compared to my old laser printer.But now to the main point. The picture quality for color replications is really amazing. Normally, colors look washed out using a laser printer. Now it can't really replicate complex colors 100%, and shadows kinda look like defining lines on colorful images. But, compared to some inject printers, this is really amazing. You also get more prints, and faster prints.Now, the only issue I have is toner replacements. I haven't needed any yet, but I cringe a bit looking at the price. When I looked last, the 414a where 140 each. Compared to the last gen M452 which is about 80 dollars for a kit of offbrand toner, and 308 for a kit of HP, which uses 410a.Would I still recommend this for professional or even households needing quick and fast printing. Absolutely, I just cringe looking at the replacement cost of toner being about the same cost as the whole system. I have a feeling the prices will drop though. About 89 dollars each is where I hope to see them in the future."

"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Quirky controls with dismal Wireless setup,2.0,"After reading numerous reviews of various printers, settled on the HP Color Laser Jet Pro M454dw. Minimal instructions provided and the setup was absolutely terrible, the printer was apparently manufactured within 30 days however had to download 13 different updates & patches. The Wireless never would connect, kept getting different error messages but mainly it claimed to fail joining my household Network due to MAC address filtering, which was not the case as the Router is set for static. Finally gave up on Wireless connectivity and tried enabling for Duplex printing only to find that when enabled, the Duplex involves manually feeding for the back page to print, very time consuming. The small touchscreen menu is painfully laid out and not intuitive. Returned and still searching for a decent Printer as this one is not it."

"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",poor print quality - smears,1.0,I'm so disappointed. I paid extra to get a quality laser printer for a home office. The manual feed pulls multiple pages at once so it jams. I have had it for 2 days and now it is printing blurry and smearing ink to other sheets.
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Auto Duplex setup,5.0,"Prints really nice copy.  I use laser gloss paper and make half size flip-up booklets.  The printer software installes as manual duplex using HP 453-4 software from HP online source.  You need to go to printers, select the HP454, then  manage, then printer properties, then device settings tab, and select Duplex Unit- installed before the machine will automatically print both sides automatically.  Once I had this in place the print output in color on gloss laser paper is faster then the Brother 4570CDW I replaced.Touch screen I do not use but is easy to read."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)","Problems More Than Once, Support Is Horrible",1.0,"I have only had this printer for a few months and multiple times I have had to contact support. I have spent hours with them for multiple problems.It is always overseas to someone that doesn't speak very good English.The HP Chat Support tool they use is horrible and disconnects while chatting with them, which means you then have to reconnect and start over with another tech.I would NEVER purchase this product, and in fact will not purchase another HP product."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Serial problems that require too much time to fix.,3.0,"First, the print quality is good and the colors are consistent. Once you get the desired product, it is going to satisfy you considering the price of the printer. This is one of four printers in our small law office and it serves me well when working. Unfortunately, the problems are many. Without notice, the default changes from pint on one side to print on both. Suddenly, it stops communicating with my PC. Maybe its the recently installed update to Windows 10. Roll that back and no change. Then it prints an email with gibberish on 50 pages or more, one line at the top of each, with no coherence in any line. Next, the PC cannot find the printer. Update drivers? None available. Now you download the ""fix it"" application and it cures everything . . . . but now the new software tells you that your PC cannot find the printer (even while it is printing) so you must close that each time you print. Finally, my first reorder of toner for the printer ran out almost as quickly as the ""starter"" set sent. My time must be spent helping my clients or with my family. One or two hours every week or two finding fixes for this HP is not worth it. This is my last HP. It's back to Canon for me."

It is quiet, prints when I tell it to.  It does not stay asleep when I print to it.Very glad I switched over from a ink cartridge to a toner printer."

I had a samsung laser & 2 epson inkjets that are on their way to the recycling center! they constantly failed me-the only thing they were consistent with, was needing tech support. hoping I'm not jinxing it by reviewing too soon, like planning the wedding on a first date... but I'll update if it changes."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",I would stay away from this printer. It jams very often!,1.0,"This printer did not meet my expectations for a Solid HP printer. I ordered it and an expansion tray and started using it the same day it arrived. The features seemed pretty nice and color output was pretty good quality. Its only after using it for a week that I discovered that at least 2 or 3 times a day the paper would Jam. I decided perhaps the paper I had was to thin (copy paper) so I bought some slightly heavier stock paper and the problem persisted so after trying almost all the solutions offered for paper jams, I decided to return it. I opted to try the higher priced M553 and that model has been working flawlessly."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Great color laser printer.,5.0,"I absolutely love this printer, I just wish the cartridges for it were not so outrageously expensive. So I still use my black and white printer whenever possible.  Do not order any other vendor cartridges for this except the HP recommended. There are a lot of cheap toner sellers out there And it‚Äôs not worth the aggravation they put you through."
"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)","Good value for the price, with duplex capability",4.0,"Bought this on sale. It‚Äôs a solid color laser jet for home use. The toner is a bit pricey and the touchscreen leaves a bit to be desired, but you can‚Äôt beat the price. It reliably does its job. The auto page duplex setting is great. No more manual flipping pages. The mobile phone printing support is really convenient too. Most printers twice the cost don‚Äôt have these features."

This is not the least expensive option, but it does everything the website says.  The setup is by far the simplest I have experienced - Got my first PC printer back in 1980.  Our previous HP Printer was still going strong after almost 10 years - but network changes have been pushing us away from wired connections.  There was a sale, and I jumped on it."

"HP Color LaserJet Pro M454dw Wireless Laser Printer, Double-Sided & Mobile Printing, Security Features,  Amazon Dash replenishment ready (W1Y45A)",Can't get it set up on WiFi,1.0,"I bought the M454dw version to get the WiFi connectivity.  Five hours later and still can't get it figured out.  I have the HP Smart app on Windows 10 and the printer is connected to the same WiFi network as my computer, but the stupid app can't find the printer.  I even did a factory reset on my new Windows 10 computer and it still didn't work.  I build computers so I'm computer savvy.  It's wonderful that I can't find any HP tech support phone number to get help.  Salt to the wound."
